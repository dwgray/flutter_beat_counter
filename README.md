# flutter_beat_counter

A simple beat counter written in [Google Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

This simple application lets you tap out the beat of a song and find the
tempo in Beats per minute and Measures per minute. There are a couple of very simple
settings to change how you count (by measure or beat) and to specify the meter.

## The project

This is part of a larger project to compare and contrast multi-platform toolsets.

I've heavily documented the code I wrote, which is contained in [lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart) - the rest of the code in this repository is generated by the framework.

Screenshots of the application on several platforms are in the [screenshots](screenshots) folder

I am documenting this project in a series of [medium.com](https://medium.com) posts.  The first post in the series "[Which Multi-platform framework should I use to write my app?](https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-f1afbf330493)" gives more context about the project and describes how the app should behave. The post that covers the Flutter implementation of the app is [Which Multi-platform framework should I use to write my app? Letâ€™s try Flutter.](https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-lets-try-flutter-2c39dedd3cd3)

You can run a version of the app in [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev) at this link [https://dartpad.dev/0fb90b38b75e71d8cfabd059c9a0aaab?]() (you need to click run in the upper right of the code window to see the app running).
